          <p>
            I am a Student in SCU. I'm from Indonesia, I am 19 years old. Highly
            interested in Website Development, Mobile Apps, AI and ML. Started
            my coding journey back when I was in High School. I work mostly in
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but I still expanding my skills, probably
            I would learn Java, PHP, Go and mostly back-end stuff. Other than
            programming I think about expanding my skills to Cyber Security and
            DevOps because I think they are look cool. Okay, let's step aside
            from computer shall we? I like to learn languages. Because I think
            those are important for the future. My hobbies are playing games,
            coding, and listening to music, mostly EDM and Rock. I love movies
            if you ask me, prolly like a horror movies, thriller or supernatural
            movies. But honestly I can go along with a lot of genres, so don't
            worry with me. Right I think these all I can say about myself,
            thankyou for reading this introduction. Goodbye.
